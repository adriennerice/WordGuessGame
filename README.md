Ocean Hangman is a Word Guess Game similar to Hangman.

Rules: Guess the correct letters to spell a word. Select a letter to start.

Issue: Accepts non letters as input. Need to add a check for non letters and require the player to enter a letter.

Issue: Used indexOf() method to check if letter was already guessed. Will not find the same letter multiple times if it is in the word multiple times. Only used words without reoccuring letters.
